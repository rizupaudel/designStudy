The last one because I understand it better.,I like the last one.,I liked the last design more because it was easier to understand.,The last one.
"I think the third design is best at helping me understand how to create a strong password. While knowing what could happen if you don't make a strong password is important, it isn't needed to make a strong password. The third design was short and to the point, which I liked.","I think the third design captured my attention and kept me engaged because it was beautiful and it gave me more information. I thought that the drawings were beautiful, so that was what captured my attention in the first place. What kept my attention was the information I was being given. Overall, the third design was pleasing to the eye and kept my attention.","I loved the third design because it got the point across well and was nice to look at. The first design had extra bits of information that I didn't feel were needed for this particular lesson. I liked the second design because it was pretty, but it wasn't as educational as the first and third. ","The second and third designs were less helpful than the first design with these criteria. The first showed what could happen if you don't use a strong password, whereas the second and third designs didn't give me as much information."
"The third one is the best in understanding how to create a strong password, because it tells how to create one and it shows how strong a password can be and what can happen if your password is not strong",The second design is captures my attention the most because it’s not too long and it’s easy to remember.,I believe the second design is number 1 because it has enough information is and easy to remember. The third one is the second favorite because it has information on how to create it and also has information on what can happen if your password is not strong. The first one is my least favorite because it only tells me how to create a strong password and there is no other information.,The third design is probably better because it tells me what can happen if your password is not strong enough and how we can create a strong password
"3rd because it shows an example of it 
happening to another person.",3rd it had a story,"3rd because it showed what can happen if you
don't have a strong password.","3rd cause hacking and to base your password

"
The second one because it gives you steps.,The first one because it like had lots of details.,Because it had very much details and it was interesting.,The first one because it had like all the reasons like how it happened and it was like very very interesting.
2nd because you can take a sentence and just take a few words and make a password.,2nd because it is a good way that you could remember the password.,because it explians better to me then the other ones.,1st because it helped me understand what to do if tour compuder is getting hacked.
The first design was the easiest for me to understand because it showed everything that happens when you don't have a secure passcode. The third design was the one that helped improve my skills on creating a secure passcode. ,I think all the designs was engaging because first of all I like reading and the animation was good two and the design was really informational. The first design was definitely the most interesting and it captured my attention the most. ,I liked the first design the most because it was the most entertaining.I liked the third slide second best because it was the most informational and captivating.I liked the second design the least because it was the least detailed. ,The first design was the most entertaining and fun but the second and third were the most informational and helpful.And the first design raised my awareness the most because it showed what actually happens when you don't have a secure password.
The middle one because it's easier for me understand because it shows that they picked the memory and then they showed that they picked four words and created a really good password.,The second one because I like how it says like to think of a memory and take four words and make a password out of it. It shows you that it picked out four of the words and put that altogether.,Second one because it's really easy for me to understand and in the first design it shows me that other people can help you if you need help.,The second one because it motivated me because it showed me that it's not that hard to create a strong password.
