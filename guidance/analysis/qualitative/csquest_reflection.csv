11-1,I think the design looks nice and it was well presented,"I think the strategy if easy to follow but I think it might be hard to know where the special characters go, and there are literally dozens of websites I visit which require a password. No way to just remember all those, no matter what strategy is followed.","I think that it is interesting and would help people create stronger passwords which would be good for security overall. Personally for me, I usually create passwords which would be just as strong or stronger than if using this advice but I like the way in which it helps you come up with a password.",very nice presentation of this design,I think that the presentation of this design is good.,The presentation is very good and it is very easy to understand the main content,"This was very interesting and something that I never thought of.  I wish I could access this somehow, so that if I was creating a new login or opening a new account I could use this so that I could create a password.  This is a very good idea.",Overall the presentation is attractive and helpful. However I doubt how much it will encourage users to use the strategy mentioned in it. ,good,The format of the password engine was good.,The design takes the creation step by step so it is easy to understand. It makes me feel dumb for not thinking of this before and using it.The only thing I would worry about is where I put the special symbols/numbers and which ones I used. I would need to come up with a way of remembering that. ,This is very useful for all.,skilles develpoing,That was very clear and understandable. It used to make a strong password,"Private memory, thought of it, first letters, numbers and symbols, strong and memorable password.",It is interesting and gets you involved. But it does make the text small and hard to see (I am doing this HIT on a 13 inch Macbook). I liked the method because it would make passwords much easier to remember.,It is straight forward and to the point.  I like it.  ,to based upon design and password hint.,I think it is simple yet very informative. It is not overly complicated so that even someone inexperienced should understand the message. I like the way it is presented and I would not change anything about it.,I liked the way it was informal and casual. It was clear and understandable.,"I'm pretty certain that it will help me create a strong password, but not a memorable one since it uses just the first letters. If I was reminded to think of a certain memory when logging in, then I would remember it easily."
