11-1,"I like the idea. I like the example phrase ""I was awarded a prize..."" I like how the first letters of each word are in green. I would need to think of a phrase that I could use. ","This is entertaining and relatable! It is an important subject matter presented in a creative, easily understandable way!",I think the design looks nice and it was well presented,"I think the strategy if easy to follow but I think it might be hard to know where the special characters go, and there are literally dozens of websites I visit which require a password. No way to just remember all those, no matter what strategy is followed.",I thought about if I would personally use this strategy to create a password or not,For me it is way too many steps as I already know how to generate an extremely strong password. Plus I use password software which keeps track of the passwords for me. Most people will not want to read all that.,"I like it, it is simple like texting with a friend",It is nice.  Simple to read and understand.  Step by step helps.  Good job overall!,I think that it is clean and concise and understandable.,It is good and very strong to create online account passwords,good,easy,I think that the presentation of this design is good.,"I like it because really clear, easy to understand and one of my worries on creating a really strong password is remembering it but this makes the steps clear so think I could remember it. ",i evalute the presentation of this design is very good and easily to work with the  desinging the process to make the password strong and learning easily,"This was very interesting and something that I never thought of.  I wish I could access this somehow, so that if I was creating a new login or opening a new account I could use this so that I could create a password.  This is a very good idea.",It is novel and creative way of learning how to create a strong password.,I think it's a great idea and a nice design.  My only issue with it is that when i'm creating a new account (which is usually somewhat annoying to begin with) i'm not sure that i would like being funneled thru such a long cartoon scenerio to direct me on something that i already know i need to do.  i think the length should be cut in half at least.  it's more drawn out and simplistic than necessary i think.,"I think it is a great presentation, and easy to understand. I use the google recommended password, so it's not for me, but I'm sure that some people will find it helpful. ",The design is eay to evaluate and give ideas to create strong passswords,I feel like it's very straight forward and remains objective throughout it's time line.,The design is interesting for people who have trouble making passwords. It allows for easier reading than just a bunch of text.,social media design,it is structured and clear.,"I like the design. I don't think it makes remembering the password feasable, however. How to remember the numbers and special characters? ","I really like how it is laid out on a whiteboard type of thing with easy to follow and labeled steps. I also like that an example is given to make understanding it much easier. I think its colorful, appealing and attention grabbing.",It was interesting and informative but I wouldnt use,its of my own provided one,It's easy to follow and I like that it's portrayed in chronological order of the steps to create a strong password.,It is interesting and gets you involved. But it does make the text small and hard to see (I am doing this HIT on a 13 inch Macbook). I liked the method because it would make passwords much easier to remember.,It is hard and useful to create some passwords in online,"The presentation of the design is very basic.
It's simple too.","I mean this is pretty great, if quite a bit too long for something meant to be widely implemented across various websites -- as it is, it would be neat to see once, and very quickly become tedious to click through when seen on multiple websites. It is on the cartoonish and plain side of things when it comes to the art, so it wouldn't work everywhere. All that said, it is pretty good and effective.","It requires one to memorize a complex password or write it down, so it is useless. I also dislike the androgynous ""expert.""",It is clear and easy to follow.  It's not complicated.  I am able to slowly follow it's steps of how it works and what to do.  One step at a time which makes it more simpler.  The design is pretty and pleasing to the eye.  I liked the thinking bubbles.  ,I think it is simple yet very informative. It is not overly complicated so that even someone inexperienced should understand the message. I like the way it is presented and I would not change anything about it.,"It looks like a text message exchange between 2 people, but the message is clear and it's definitely unique.",It's very creative and easy to understand with simple conversational language and the pictorial design.,social media presentation,It is easy to evaluate and create ideas for strong passwords,"I think it is straight forward and presents a manner of creating a stronger password than many people would attempt. It is a good idea to relate it to a life event. I think I create strong passwords but I have to write them down. This method might actually allow me to create something strong that I can actually retain. I answered the above question as a 4 because I already create pretty robust passwords. I don't think I'll create stronger with this method, but I certainly create something I don't have to write down. ",It is easy to evaluate and create some strong passwords,It was simple and clean.,"It's in a simple comic format that nothing really changes from each panel aside for text, basic stylized design.",Seems simple and affective. I wish the numbers and special characters came up with a similarly memorable example.
