11-1,"This is entertaining and relatable! It is an important subject matter presented in a creative, easily understandable way!",I thought about if I would personally use this strategy to create a password or not,It is nice.  Simple to read and understand.  Step by step helps.  Good job overall!,I think that it is clean and concise and understandable.,good,easy,It is novel and creative way of learning how to create a strong password.,I think it's a great idea and a nice design.  My only issue with it is that when i'm creating a new account (which is usually somewhat annoying to begin with) i'm not sure that i would like being funneled thru such a long cartoon scenerio to direct me on something that i already know i need to do.  i think the length should be cut in half at least.  it's more drawn out and simplistic than necessary i think.,The design is eay to evaluate and give ideas to create strong passswords,"I mean this is pretty great, if quite a bit too long for something meant to be widely implemented across various websites -- as it is, it would be neat to see once, and very quickly become tedious to click through when seen on multiple websites. It is on the cartoonish and plain side of things when it comes to the art, so it wouldn't work everywhere. All that said, it is pretty good and effective.",It's very creative and easy to understand with simple conversational language and the pictorial design.,"It's in a simple comic format that nothing really changes from each panel aside for text, basic stylized design."
