11-1,"This is entertaining and relatable! It is an important subject matter presented in a creative, easily understandable way!",I thought about if I would personally use this strategy to create a password or not,It is nice.  Simple to read and understand.  Step by step helps.  Good job overall!,I like it. It gave me a way to come up with a new password that I had never considered before.,I think that it is clean and concise and understandable.,good,easy,The presentation of the design is very attractive ,It is novel and creative way of learning how to create a strong password.,I think it's a great idea and a nice design.  My only issue with it is that when i'm creating a new account (which is usually somewhat annoying to begin with) i'm not sure that i would like being funneled thru such a long cartoon scenerio to direct me on something that i already know i need to do.  i think the length should be cut in half at least.  it's more drawn out and simplistic than necessary i think.,The design is eay to evaluate and give ideas to create strong passswords,I think it's very classy and professional. ,IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO MAKE A STRONG AND SECURE PASSWORD. THE PRESENTATION IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.,"I mean this is pretty great, if quite a bit too long for something meant to be widely implemented across various websites -- as it is, it would be neat to see once, and very quickly become tedious to click through when seen on multiple websites. It is on the cartoonish and plain side of things when it comes to the art, so it wouldn't work everywhere. All that said, it is pretty good and effective.",IN THIS PRESENTATION HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOWLEDGABLE.,very nice presentation of this design,It's very creative and easy to understand with simple conversational language and the pictorial design.,"Organized, clear and a good idea message not thought of before seeing it.","novel, engaging","Very well done, it makes it appealing to read it.",the presentation will very nice and  very good design,"It's in a simple comic format that nothing really changes from each panel aside for text, basic stylized design.",It is very useful in guiding about the password setting.,"The presentation is clear and concise. Straight forward and to the point. With that said, I think it's a horrible idea and will create passwords that people will not remember."
